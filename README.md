# Data-Structure-Linked-List-is-the-Radix-Sort
The application you will implement with Linked List is the Radix Sort.
Your application should be able to sort a list of strings from an input file using Radix Sort.
Assume the maximum length of the input string is 15 characters; the input file would contain an unspecified number of strings. The input file should contain one string in each line. Having read the strings successfully, your application should then sort the input strings using the Radix Sort algorithm.
The user should be displayed a menu with the options necessary to run the functionalities of the program (i.e., read the input file, print the strings before sorting, sort the strings, print the sorted strings, and exit).
